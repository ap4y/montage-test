** Setting up a database

This project uses [[http://knexjs.org][knex]] for managing DB migrations. In both development
and productions environments DB connection will be sourced from the
~DATABASE_URL~ env, which uses conventional connection string format
(~postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db~).

You can migrate to the latest DB schema via ~knex migrate:latest~.
